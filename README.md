Mediation Analysis in Julia
===========================

This package uses the approach of Imai et al. to conduct
causal mediation analysis in Julia.  At this point, models
in the GLM package can be used for the mediator and outcome
models.

There is no documentation yet, see the examples directory
and the tests.
